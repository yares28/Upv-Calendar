# UPV Calendar App Refactoring Summary

## Problem Statement
The original application used both MongoDB and PostgreSQL databases, leading to data synchronization issues and preventing PostgreSQL data from showing up in the frontend.

## Solution Approach
We completely refactored the application to use PostgreSQL exclusively, creating a clean architecture that follows best practices.

## Key Changes

### Database Layer
1. Created a comprehensive PostgreSQL schema with proper relationships
2. Implemented seed data for testing and development
3. Set up TypeORM for object-relational mapping with TypeScript
4. Organized models with proper relationships and constraints

### Backend Service Layer
1. Created service classes to encapsulate database operations
2. Implemented proper error handling and logging
3. Added type safety with TypeScript interfaces
4. Used repository pattern for data access

### Controllers and Routes
1. Rewrote controllers to use the new service layer
2. Updated routes to match the new controller methods
3. Implemented proper authentication middleware
4. Added input validation and error handling

### Frontend Integration
1. Updated frontend services to work with the new backend
2. Modified data models to match the PostgreSQL schema
3. Enhanced error handling and logging
4. Updated authentication to use JWT tokens

### Testing
1. Added database connection and data initialization tests
2. Created test utilities to reset the database between tests
3. Implemented tests for both positive and negative cases

## Benefits of the New Architecture
1. **Single Source of Truth**: All data is now stored in PostgreSQL
2. **Type Safety**: TypeScript interfaces ensure data consistency
3. **Better Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling at all levels
4. **Maintainability**: Clean separation of concerns with service/controller pattern
5. **Testability**: Modular code that can be easily tested

## Database Initialization

To set up the database from scratch:
```bash
# Initialize the database schema
npm run db:init

# Seed the database with initial data
npm run db:seed

# Alternatively, run both commands at once
npm run db:reset
```

## Testing the Implementation
Run the database connectivity test to ensure everything is working:
```bash
npm run test:db
```

## Next Steps
1. Add more comprehensive end-to-end testing
2. Implement database migrations for future schema changes
3. Add more robust error handling for edge cases
4. Consider adding database transactions for multi-step operations
